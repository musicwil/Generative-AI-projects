So if you're like me, that's a huge selling point.  You can customize everything on the guy, down to their socks and bling-bling earrings.Gameplay is really quite easy to learn and quite easy to be good at.  This may be a problem for some of the purists/realists, but for people who just want to pick up the game, play and be good, it works well.  Unlike real golf, the gameplay isn't frustrating!But what is agonizingly frustrating is the putting.  You get virtually no idea of what way the green is going.  All you have to go by is the Caddy's Advice, who tells you to aim 2 feet left and 3 feet long.  How far is a foot?  I have no idea!  It's usually just pure luck if you knock down a put of any distance.I think the old &quot;Golf&quot; game on Nintendo had a better putting gameplay (and that was 15 years ago).If you can get past the putting, this game is great fun.  The career mode seems quite lengthy and will probably keep me entertained for hours upon hours.

Road racing, F-1, rally.To date, I still feel that Gran Turismo 3 provides the best racing experience and realism.  The subtle feel changes you can sense with the weight shifting in the vehicle.  The differences bewteen front-wheel, rear-wheel and all-wheel drive cars.  And the way your driving style has to adjust from low powered little cars, up to sports, high-performance, GTO and GTP cars.  It's THE reason that I bought a PS2 instead of an X-Box after my PS1 was stolen.The only shortcoming in my opinion is the behavior of the AI cars.  The most you ever see is a 6 car field (including yourself), and the stack of 5 competitors isn't always balanced.Oh, and I miss being able to modify your cars into the racing paint schemes that you could get in GT2.But the Rally in GT3 is awesome.I just wish the GT3 guys would use their talent to write some other racing games, like a full blown true F-1 game with GT3 level realism, or WRC Rally.\",\n          \"I got one of these for my son and one for me.

The levels are great on any difficulty, and I love the Elite missions. They are fun and challenging, a great twist to the game. The only two things I wished that did not happen in the game was the short storyline, and the ending. They leave you hanging, waiting for the third Halo. Campaign is fun, but it is not a fun game unless it has a good multiplayer. The multiplayer maps are great, but there are not enough of them. Bungie could have waited a while to bring out the game to make more multiplayer maps. Overall a good game.Campaign- 4 starsMultiplayer- 4 starsFun- 5 starsAlso here are some cheats:To get the blind skull start the map Outskirts. Walk through the first door and crouch jump onto one of the lights. Then look to the leftand you will see a wall. Run at the wall and crouch jump onto that wall.

Walk through the first door and crouch jump onto one of the lights. Then look to the leftand you will see a wall. Run at the wall and crouch jump onto that wall.

Another plus about this is when you beat the game you can play the original Wolfenstein 3D game, this is definally worth buying.

Besides having an original universe, story, and characters it is most well known for the unique gameplay with the very innovative and fun Real-Time Card-Based battle system. Also the graphics and soundtrack on this game is among the best found on the Gamecube or any platform really.The kind of things that make the real-time card based battle system really fun are:1. Each card has one or more number and you can select the cards using the numbers to create pairs, strings, etc to create combo attacks that do extra damage2. Each card can evolve and change over time using the real-time clock so that something like a meat card which is a health item will become rotten meat card over time and then can be used as an offensive card that causes poisoning3. Different cards when combined logically can yield new cards. A simple example is using a wood card followed by fire card will yield burnt wood card. Plenty of combinations to discover.4. You the player are a spirit that resides in the main character. Throughout the game you are prompted with choices. The more your choice is in sync with the game character the more likely you will be to get defensive cards during the defence and also you will be more likely to get cards during your attack to continue building your combo.5. Cards can have attributes like water or fire which can cause additional damage (especially if used against enemies weak to certain element). However if you use a water and fire card in the same attack then you will cancel out the elemental effect/damage.6. Even though there are large variety of cards they add to variety instead of becoming cumbersome deck management like other card based games. This one is more about the combos then it is about the card statistics and this keeps the game more action oriented.\",\n","     \"Zero_sentiment\": \"positive\", \"Ground_Truth\": \"positive\"},\n","    {\"Review\": \"This is a really fun game. You play a hot and stealthy female ninja seeking revenge on a rival clan. The controls are not bad. The controls are actually pretty good, especially swinging on the wire. Good control is something I really value in a game, so believe me. This game would not be possible if it had weak controls (There is alot of acrobatics that you need to perform in order to progress). If you like games like blood rayne, you should give red ninja a try. This is a much better stealth killer then 'manhunt'.I do agree that the camera angles can be a pain sometimes, but that hardly drags the game down to one star. People expect way too much from video games these days. if games are too easy people whine, and if they are challenging (like Red Ninja) people give up to easy and whine.story=4.5 starssound=3.5 starscontrols=4 starsgraphics=4 starsfun=4.5\",\n","     \"Zero_sentiment\": \"negative\", \"Ground_Truth\": \"positive\"},\n","    {\"Review\": \"Resident Evil is the greatest survival horror series ever, no doubt. What you may not know is that the first Resident Evil game was originally intended as a first person shooter, ala Doom.That didn't happen (thank goodness!) but Capcom DID make a FPS Resident Evil game, and this is it. This is the first in the Gun Survivor series followed by Resident Evil Dead Aim, Dino Stalker and Code Veronica 2 a Europe only game that has no bearing on the overall plot.This IS a canon game in the series. The events are mentioned in the opening of Resident Evil Zero on Gamecube.The graphics are nice because they are from the golden age of playstation and follow in the tradition of Resident Evil 2 and 3. Many complain about this game but it really is not so bad. It's not a shooter as good as Goldeneye for Nintendo 64, of course, but it's not too shabby in it's own right.The locations are nice and it has that special playstation charm to it, gotta love it. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because of no light gun support.\",\n","     \"Zero_sentiment\": \"negative\", \"Ground_Truth\": \"positive\"},\n","    {\"Review\": \"This game symbolizes an era gone for me.

It is a much better game than both Halo games as well.After playing this I really think that first person shooters will actually have GOOD stories of wich Halo greatly lacked.Multiplay is a little crazy and I only like to play it to see what kind of maps people can come up with.I love this game and would choose it over any other fps out there. WAY, WAY better than Halo 1 or 2.

Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life will bring back my favorite qualities (ie dating, marriage, time progression)with some new features as well. I've heard there will be new farm animals (pigs?) and the ability to cross vegetables (wow!). The animation is as cute as ever, and I can't wait to hear the music. I will be very excited to receive my copy of Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life.   \n","1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The Game is not even playable single player its online only with 0 Servers.

Real sunshine!) to do it.  Game environments even alter themselves depending on whether it is day or night.  Perfect.  But other aspects of gameplay are remarkable, as well: in keeping with the Metal Gear design, you are urged to sneak around and strategize.  In fact, limited sun-power during nighttime gameplay actually necessitates it.It's true that this a new way of playing.  Still, sometimes the gameplay and puzzles are a little dull and repetitive--which is heartbreakingly disappointing given the attention paid to all other aspects of game design.  Boktai is conceptually thrilling, but the actual game is just sort of... not.  Gameplay simply isn't quite what it should have been.Still, sheer innovation tops Boktai's design flaws.  And absolutely nothing is more exciting than going to the park on a sunny day, finding a bench in a nice patch of light, turning on my GBA, and hearing it say to me, &quot;Today is one great Boktai day!&quot; I can't help but think to myself, &quot;Isn't it?&quot;   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The superboy plays Gameboy games on your snes (it works on retro duo too!). There is a border for the game that looks like a gameboy. You can also choose borders and color your own, paint and doodle.  For some games (ex: Donkey Kong (arcade) there are special themes borders and...it's in color!  Your  games will sound awesome when played on your t.v., those bleeps and bloops will really shine! You can also change the color pattern of games to your liking.  10/10 highly recommended, buy it!   \n","5                                 I don't normally play video games, but I'm a huge fan of Civilization 3.  Too huge in fact - it's a real problem for me.  I find myself skipping meals when I play this game.  Civilization 3 is my favorite of the Civilization series.  I think the zone of controls concept is natural to the gameplay, and the ability to have cultural takeovers of other cities is fun.  Some of the oddities and cheapness of the previous versions have been removed - it's not really possible to build every single wonder, for instance.I hadn't played the game in a while, so I decided to get this complete package when I saw it at the store.  However, the several years of updates have really hurt this game.  The problems haven't been addressed - most notably, the diplomacy AI is terrible, and the endgame, with its emphasis on large amounts of indivisual military units, is so ridiculously slow that I can still only rarely make it through without quitting, frustrated.  Instead, the main change is that resources are much more scarce.  These recourses are essential to the progress of your game.  However you have no way of knowing if you'll have, say, a coal resource somewhere in your map, until you've already been playing for 5 hours.If the scarcity was a matter of instigating small military attacks on your neighbors, or heavy diplomacy, that would be fine.  However, this weakness plays off the game's other weakenesses.  Often the necessary resource will only be available halfway around the world.  Launching a military attack is so ridiculously slow that it isn't worth the time even for the most addictive player (that being: me).  And the diplomacy AI is so worthless that other empires won't trade their essential resources even when you throw ridiculous sums of money and technology at them.Anyway, it's no fun to play for hours and hours before you find that your game is a lost cause due to the map you were given.  Also, the expansion disks are (to my mind) worthless.  So I'd strongly recommend just buying the earlier editions of Civilization 3, which are much cheaper.   \n","6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1080 Avalanche is definately a fun game in the sense of speed, but it comes to an overall game, such as tricks and custimization, buy SSX3!Control: 3/5Im sorry, but I have to have big air and tricks. The way I see it, if I can't pull of awesome combos, things are bad. But, the system where you can get back on balance if you mess up a jump is cool.Sound: 5/5The reason Sound gets 5? I LOVE THE SOUNDTRACK. The song &quot;Choke&quot; is amazing, and is really something that you could snowboard to. The sound of the snow under the board is crisp as well.Modes and Extras: 2/5The Match Race is pretty much the only thing worth it, and even that isn't very good. The characters are limited, the boards are limited, and there isn't really any customization or unlockables.Overall: 3/5The game is cool if you like speed, but the tricks suck and you can only hold a jump for 2 seconds. I reccomend you buy SSX3 instead of this, or you can buy this too. Whatever floats your boat!   \n","7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The story was OK, I was not taken away with it since it's the usual 'Last of species, princess in trouble, hero with daddy-problem' stuff.The characters had some personality, it was never developed beyond looking like comic characters, I just never took them seriously.The graphics are ugly, I do not like that they are so small, I could barely see Vivi.But the absolute worst part is the battle-system, it almost takes a whole minute just to load all the characters, monsters and angle the camera correctly.So much time is wasted just wating for the battle to load.So when you meet weak monsters you kill with a blow, you seriously get more than annoyed because it takes longer time to load the fight than to actually finish it!Sad way to ruin a possibly could be fantastic game.   \n","8   When you add the two together you should come up with one heck of a game. What happened here is that the strategic, political and conscript aspects from ROTK were summarized into pairs, and issued to you as suggestions by your leaders.  You can refuse their ideas, and save your gold, which you need to hire captured enemy generals.  The map is a bit smaller than ROTK and with far less provinces.  Despite this, the game is incredible.  If you have ever wanted to fight a la DW while you were playing ROTK, this is it...  You make your plans, hire men, whatever, then choose to attack or perhaps you sit and watch this turn unfold, saving money and manpower.  Unlike DW though, the gates are everywhere, and they are now strongholds, which you must take to gain the edge.  Also, generals can die 3 times in one battle.  Oh yeah, they come back 3 times, and get harder each time.  In a normal battle you might have to kill 15 generals. Actually only 5 but you did it 3 times each.  They re-appear out of nowhere with a portion of their original force.  Kind of annoying.  A cool aspect of this is... For once you can finally be the only general on the screen, if you want that is.  Send yourself in alone against 50000 enemy troops.  The weapons and items are the same but harder to come by.  Your provinces give you certain items, that you can only use once every 5 turns.  Be carefull what you use.  Your weapon gets stronger based on your level, just like DW.  The number of men under your command is based on your achievements like in ROTK.  Form alliances and help defend other lords.  You gain rewards for this.  During battle your AI generals can use their 'skills' once per battle like in ROTK.  Create an officer is better but nothing to get excited about.  You can choose from a few different looks but the bottom line is you still look stupid.  Oh, and I have yet to see any of the trademark Bodyguards.  I miss that. Basically, Koei has taken good parts of each game and put it together.  What more could you want?  Oh yeah, no two player co-op, so I guess that is one thing you could want.   \n","9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   This game could have been a heck of alot better.

As another reviewer said, they could have sold a million copies of a mediocre game, but this one is very good. My seven year old daughter and I played 'Socerer's Stone' first. We enjoyed it, but it was a bit clunky. Next we started playing this one. We're almost 20 hours into it already, less than half way through, and having a great time. This one has great replay value-we're going to go back and find the wizard cards we missed.This one took everything that was good about the first game, got rid of what didn't work, and added a lot more. So you get more spells, more places to explore, more options, more fun.If you get this in the 'World of Harry Potter' collection, you'll get four games for twenty smackers. Great value!   \n","11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This is a game worth playing and since it's been out about 2 years or a little longer it's affordable. I'm a fan of the original Wolfenstein 3D and this game is still worthy of the name. Great game play, sound, weapons and decent graphics. Another plus about this is when you beat the game you can play the original Wolfenstein 3D game, this is definally worth buying. Once you get used to the controls and how the game is played out you'll get hooked.   \n","12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          good, but games like golden sun are a lot better. heres how it lays out:graphics:2sound:3 nothing specialstory:4gameplay:3 too much magicoverall:3.5 if u want an Rpg, get golden sun instead.   \n","13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This is a well-balanced fun action-adventure game.

Besides having an original universe, story, and characters it is most well known for the unique gameplay with the very innovative and fun Real-Time Card-Based battle system. Also the graphics and soundtrack on this game is among the best found on the Gamecube or any platform really.The kind of things that make the real-time card based battle system really fun are:1. Each card has one or more number and you can select the cards using the numbers to create pairs, strings, etc to create combo attacks that do extra damage2. Each card can evolve and change over time using the real-time clock so that something like a meat card which is a health item will become rotten meat card over time and then can be used as an offensive card that causes poisoning3. Different cards when combined logically can yield new cards. A simple example is using a wood card followed by fire card will yield burnt wood card. Plenty of combinations to discover.4. You the player are a spirit that resides in the main character. Throughout the game you are prompted with choices. The more your choice is in sync with the game character the more likely you will be to get defensive cards during the defence and also you will be more likely to get cards during your attack to continue building your combo.5. Cards can have attributes like water or fire which can cause additional damage (especially if used against enemies weak to certain element). However if you use a water and fire card in the same attack then you will cancel out the elemental effect/damage.6. Even though there are large variety of cards they add to variety instead of becoming cumbersome deck management like other card based games. This one is more about the combos then it is about the card statistics and this keeps the game more action oriented.   \n","15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     This is a really fun game. You play a hot and stealthy female ninja seeking revenge on a rival clan. The controls are not bad. The controls are actually pretty good, especially swinging on the wire. Good control is something I really value in a game, so believe me. This game would not be possible if it had weak controls (There is alot of acrobatics that you need to perform in order to progress). If you like games like blood rayne, you should give red ninja a try. This is a much better stealth killer then 'manhunt'.I do agree that the camera angles can be a pain sometimes, but that hardly drags the game down to one star. People expect way too much from video games these days. if games are too easy people whine, and if they are challenging (like Red Ninja) people give up to easy and whine.story=4.5 starssound=3.5 starscontrols=4 starsgraphics=4 starsfun=4.5   \n","16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Resident Evil is the greatest survival horror series ever, no doubt. What you may not know is that the first Resident Evil game was originally intended as a first person shooter, ala Doom.That didn't happen (thank goodness!) but Capcom DID make a FPS Resident Evil game, and this is it. This is the first in the Gun Survivor series followed by Resident Evil Dead Aim, Dino Stalker and Code Veronica 2 a Europe only game that has no bearing on the overall plot.This IS a canon game in the series. The events are mentioned in the opening of Resident Evil Zero on Gamecube.The graphics are nice because they are from the golden age of playstation and follow in the tradition of Resident Evil 2 and 3. Many complain about this game but it really is not so bad. It's not a shooter as good as Goldeneye for Nintendo 64, of course, but it's not too shabby in it's own right.The locations are nice and it has that special playstation charm to it, gotta love it. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because of no light gun support.   \n","17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       This game symbolizes an era gone for me.

Real sunshine!) to do it.  Game environments even alter themselves depending on whether it is day or night.  Perfect.

In fact, limited sun-power during nighttime gameplay actually necessitates it.It's true that this a new way of playing.  Still, sometimes the gameplay and puzzles are a little dull and repetitive--which is heartbreakingly disappointing given the attention paid to all other aspects of game design.  Boktai is conceptually thrilling, but the actual game is just sort of... not.  Gameplay simply isn't quite what it should have been.Still, sheer innovation tops Boktai's design flaws.

Too huge in fact - it's a real problem for me.  I find myself skipping meals when I play this game.  Civilization 3 is my favorite of the Civilization series.  I think the zone of controls concept is natural to the gameplay, and the ability to have cultural takeovers of other cities is fun.  Some of the oddities and cheapness of the previous versions have been removed - it's not really possible to build every single wonder, for instance.I hadn't played the game in a while, so I decided to get this complete package when I saw it at the store.  However, the several years of updates have really hurt this game.  The problems haven't been addressed - most notably, the diplomacy AI is terrible, and the endgame, with its emphasis on large amounts of indivisual military units, is so ridiculously slow that I can still only rarely make it through without quitting, frustrated.  Instead, the main change is that resources are much more scarce.  These recourses are essential to the progress of your game.  However you have no way of knowing if you'll have, say, a coal resource somewhere in your map, until you've already been playing for 5 hours.If the scarcity was a matter of instigating small military attacks on your neighbors, or heavy diplomacy, that would be fine.  However, this weakness plays off the game's other weakenesses.  Often the necessary resource will only be available halfway around the world.  Launching a military attack is so ridiculously slow that it isn't worth the time even for the most addictive player (that being: me).  And the diplomacy AI is so worthless that other empires won't trade their essential resources even when you throw ridiculous sums of money and technology at them.Anyway, it's no fun to play for hours and hours before you find that your game is a lost cause due to the map you were given.  Also, the expansion disks are (to my mind) worthless.  So I'd strongly recommend just buying the earlier editions of Civilization 3, which are much cheaper.</td>\n","      <td>positive</td>\n","      <td>negative</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>1080 Avalanche is definately a fun game in the sense of speed, but it comes to an overall game, such as tricks and custimization, buy SSX3!Control: 3/5Im sorry, but I have to have big air and tricks.

What happened here is that the strategic, political and conscript aspects from ROTK were summarized into pairs, and issued to you as suggestions by your leaders.  You can refuse their ideas, and save your gold, which you need to hire captured enemy generals.  The map is a bit smaller than ROTK and with far less provinces.  Despite this, the game is incredible.  If you have ever wanted to fight a la DW while you were playing ROTK, this is it...  You make your plans, hire men, whatever, then choose to attack or perhaps you sit and watch this turn unfold, saving money and manpower.  Unlike DW though, the gates are everywhere, and they are now strongholds, which you must take to gain the edge.  Also, generals can die 3 times in one battle.  Oh yeah, they come back 3 times, and get harder each time.  In a normal battle you might have to kill 15 generals. Actually only 5 but you did it 3 times each.  They re-appear out of nowhere with a portion of their original force.  Kind of annoying.  A cool aspect of this is... For once you can finally be the only general on the screen, if you want that is.  Send yourself in alone against 50000 enemy troops.  The weapons and items are the same but harder to come by.  Your provinces give you certain items, that you can only use once every 5 turns.  Be carefull what you use.  Your weapon gets stronger based on your level, just like DW.  The number of men under your command is based on your achievements like in ROTK.  Form alliances and help defend other lords.  You gain rewards for this.  During battle your AI generals can use their 'skills' once per battle like in ROTK.  Create an officer is better but nothing to get excited about.  You can choose from a few different looks but the bottom line is you still look stupid.

Besides having an original universe, story, and characters it is most well known for the unique gameplay with the very innovative and fun Real-Time Card-Based battle system. Also the graphics and soundtrack on this game is among the best found on the Gamecube or any platform really.The kind of things that make the real-time card based battle system really fun are:1. Each card has one or more number and you can select the cards using the numbers to create pairs, strings, etc to create combo attacks that do extra damage2. Each card can evolve and change over time using the real-time clock so that something like a meat card which is a health item will become rotten meat card over time and then can be used as an offensive card that causes poisoning3. Different cards when combined logically can yield new cards. A simple example is using a wood card followed by fire card will yield burnt wood card. Plenty of combinations to discover.4. You the player are a spirit that resides in the main character. Throughout the game you are prompted with choices. The more your choice is in sync with the game character the more likely you will be to get defensive cards during the defence and also you will be more likely to get cards during your attack to continue building your combo.5. Cards can have attributes like water or fire which can cause additional damage (especially if used against enemies weak to certain element). However if you use a water and fire card in the same attack then you will cancel out the elemental effect/damage.6. Even though there are large variety of cards they add to variety instead of becoming cumbersome deck management like other card based games. This one is more about the combos then it is about the card statistics and this keeps the game more action oriented.</td>\n","      <td>positive</td>\n","      <td>positive</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>15</th>\n","      <td>This is a really fun game.

Too huge in fact - it's a real problem for me.  I find myself skipping meals when I play this game.  Civilization 3 is my favorite of the Civilization series.  I think the zone of controls concept is natural to the gameplay, and the ability to have cultural takeovers of other cities is fun.  Some of the oddities and cheapness of the previous versions have been removed - it's not really possible to build every single wonder, for instance.I hadn't played the game in a while, so I decided to get this complete package when I saw it at the store.  However, the several years of updates have really hurt this game.  The problems haven't been addressed - most notably, the diplomacy AI is terrible, and the endgame, with its emphasis on large amounts of indivisual military units, is so ridiculously slow that I can still only rarely make it through without quitting, frustrated.  Instead, the main change is that resources are much more scarce.  These recourses are essential to the progress of your game.  However you have no way of knowing if you'll have, say, a coal resource somewhere in your map, until you've already been playing for 5 hours.If the scarcity was a matter of instigating small military attacks on your neighbors, or heavy diplomacy, that would be fine.  However, this weakness plays off the game's other weakenesses.  Often the necessary resource will only be available halfway around the world.  Launching a military attack is so ridiculously slow that it isn't worth the time even for the most addictive player (that being: me).  And the diplomacy AI is so worthless that other empires won't trade their essential resources even when you throw ridiculous sums of money and technology at them.Anyway, it's no fun to play for hours and hours before you find that your game is a lost cause due to the map you were given.  Also, the expansion disks are (to my mind) worthless.  So I'd strongly recommend just buying the earlier editions of Civilization 3, which are much cheaper.\",\n          \"This is a game worth playing and since it's been out about 2 years or a little longer it's affordable.

What happened here is that the strategic, political and conscript aspects from ROTK were summarized into pairs, and issued to you as suggestions by your leaders.  You can refuse their ideas, and save your gold, which you need to hire captured enemy generals.  The map is a bit smaller than ROTK and with far less provinces.  Despite this, the game is incredible.  If you have ever wanted to fight a la DW while you were playing ROTK, this is it...  You make your plans, hire men, whatever, then choose to attack or perhaps you sit and watch this turn unfold, saving money and manpower.  Unlike DW though, the gates are everywhere, and they are now strongholds, which you must take to gain the edge.  Also, generals can die 3 times in one battle.  Oh yeah, they come back 3 times, and get harder each time.  In a normal battle you might have to kill 15 generals. Actually only 5 but you did it 3 times each.  They re-appear out of nowhere with a portion of their original force.  Kind of annoying.  A cool aspect of this is... For once you can finally be the only general on the screen, if you want that is.  Send yourself in alone against 50000 enemy troops.  The weapons and items are the same but harder to come by.  Your provinces give you certain items, that you can only use once every 5 turns.  Be carefull what you use.  Your weapon gets stronger based on your level, just like DW.  The number of men under your command is based on your achievements like in ROTK.  Form alliances and help defend other lords.  You gain rewards for this.  During battle your AI generals can use their 'skills' once per battle like in ROTK.  Create an officer is better but nothing to get excited about.  You can choose from a few different looks but the bottom line is you still look stupid.  Oh, and I have yet to see any of the trademark Bodyguards.  I miss that. Basically, Koei has taken good parts of each game and put it together.  What more could you want?

Besides having an original universe, story, and characters it is most well known for the unique gameplay with the very innovative and fun Real-Time Card-Based battle system. Also the graphics and soundtrack on this game is among the best found on the Gamecube or any platform really.The kind of things that make the real-time card based battle system really fun are:1. Each card has one or more number and you can select the cards using the numbers to create pairs, strings, etc to create combo attacks that do extra damage2. Each card can evolve and change over time using the real-time clock so that something like a meat card which is a health item will become rotten meat card over time and then can be used as an offensive card that causes poisoning3. Different cards when combined logically can yield new cards. A simple example is using a wood card followed by fire card will yield burnt wood card. Plenty of combinations to discover.4. You the player are a spirit that resides in the main character. Throughout the game you are prompted with choices. The more your choice is in sync with the game character the more likely you will be to get defensive cards during the defence and also you will be more likely to get cards during your attack to continue building your combo.5. Cards can have attributes like water or fire which can cause additional damage (especially if used against enemies weak to certain element). However if you use a water and fire card in the same attack then you will cancel out the elemental effect/damage.6. Even though there are large variety of cards they add to variety instead of becoming cumbersome deck management like other card based games. This one is more about the combos then it is about the card statistics and this keeps the game more action oriented.',\n","  'Ground_Truth': 'positive'},\n"," {'Review': \"This is a really fun game. You play a hot and stealthy female ninja seeking revenge on a rival clan. The controls are not bad. The controls are actually pretty good, especially swinging on the wire. Good control is something I really value in a game, so believe me. This game would not be possible if it had weak controls (There is alot of acrobatics that you need to perform in order to progress). If you like games like blood rayne, you should give red ninja a try. This is a much better stealth killer then 'manhunt'.I do agree that the camera angles can be a pain sometimes, but that hardly drags the game down to one star.

What happened here is that the strategic, political and conscript aspects from ROTK were summarized into pairs, and issued to you as suggestions by your leaders.  You can refuse their ideas, and save your gold, which you need to hire captured enemy generals.  The map is a bit smaller than ROTK and with far less provinces.  Despite this, the game is incredible.  If you have ever wanted to fight a la DW while you were playing ROTK, this is it...  You make your plans, hire men, whatever, then choose to attack or perhaps you sit and watch this turn unfold, saving money and manpower.  Unlike DW though, the gates are everywhere, and they are now strongholds, which you must take to gain the edge.  Also, generals can die 3 times in one battle.  Oh yeah, they come back 3 times, and get harder each time.  In a normal battle you might have to kill 15 generals. Actually only 5 but you did it 3 times each.  They re-appear out of nowhere with a portion of their original force.  Kind of annoying.  A cool aspect of this is... For once you can finally be the only general on the screen, if you want that is.  Send yourself in alone against 50000 enemy troops.  The weapons and items are the same but harder to come by.  Your provinces give you certain items, that you can only use once every 5 turns.  Be carefull what you use.  Your weapon gets stronger based on your level, just like DW.  The number of men under your command is based on your achievements like in ROTK.  Form alliances and help defend other lords.  You gain rewards for this.  During battle your AI generals can use their 'skills' once per battle like in ROTK.  Create an officer is better but nothing to get excited about.  You can choose from a few different looks but the bottom line is you still look stupid.  Oh, and I have yet to see any of the trademark Bodyguards.  I miss that. Basically, Koei has taken good parts of each game and put it together.  What more could you want?

Besides having an original universe, story, and characters it is most well known for the unique gameplay with the very innovative and fun Real-Time Card-Based battle system. Also the graphics and soundtrack on this game is among the best found on the Gamecube or any platform really.The kind of things that make the real-time card based battle system really fun are:1. Each card has one or more number and you can select the cards using the numbers to create pairs, strings, etc to create combo attacks that do extra damage2. Each card can evolve and change over time using the real-time clock so that something like a meat card which is a health item will become rotten meat card over time and then can be used as an offensive card that causes poisoning3. Different cards when combined logically can yield new cards. A simple example is using a wood card followed by fire card will yield burnt wood card. Plenty of combinations to discover.4. You the player are a spirit that resides in the main character. Throughout the game you are prompted with choices. The more your choice is in sync with the game character the more likely you will be to get defensive cards during the defence and also you will be more likely to get cards during your attack to continue building your combo.5. Cards can have attributes like water or fire which can cause additional damage (especially if used against enemies weak to certain element). However if you use a water and fire card in the same attack then you will cancel out the elemental effect/damage.6. Even though there are large variety of cards they add to variety instead of becoming cumbersome deck management like other card based games. This one is more about the combos then it is about the card statistics and this keeps the game more action oriented.```'},\n"," {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'positive'},\n"," {'role': 'user',\n","  'content': \"```This is a really fun game.

The process included filtering and processing thousands of user reviews, classifying them as either **positive** or **negative**, and aggregating the results at the product (ASIN) level.\n","\n","To enrich our insights, we retrieved game titles using the Tavily search API, cross-referenced with ASINs, and compiled a final ranking of the **top 10 and bottom 10 video games** based on the ratio of positive to total reviews.\n","\n","Key accomplishments include:\n","\n","* ✅ Implemented a few-shot prompting strategy with example-based guidance.\n","* ✅ Processed and classified thousands of reviews in efficient batches with intermediate saving for fault tolerance.\n","* ✅ Merged predictions into a clean output format for later reuse.\n","* ✅ Retrieved and matched game titles using a search API for clearer presentation.\n","* ✅ Computed and displayed final scores per product, ranking games based on sentiment outcomes.\n","* ✅ Cleanly visualized the top and bottom performers using styled HTML for presentation.\n","\n","This end-to-end pipeline is fully **reproducible and scalable**, meaning it can be reused to evaluate new or unseen datasets with minimal changes. By simply replacing the input dataset, the same code structure can be applied to any collection of product reviews, enabling consistent and reliable sentiment-based product ranking.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"DDmHsWo5xjdL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"lrKv33Zj5lwF"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
