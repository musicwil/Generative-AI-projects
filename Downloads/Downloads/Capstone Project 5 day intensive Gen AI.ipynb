        "## 1. Introduction: Use Case and Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates the creation of a simulated AI-powered travel agent specializing in weekend getaways to the Caribbean. The core problem is that traditional travel websites often rely on static listings or rigid, rule-based recommendation systems, making it difficult for users to discover personalized and engaging travel options that truly match their unique interests and preferences. This project explores how a Large Language Model (LLM) can dynamically generate relevant promotional content and interpret user queries in a more flexible and context-aware manner, offering a more intuitive and personalized travel planning experience. While this notebook presents a simulation and does not connect to real-time booking or inventory systems, it effectively showcases the potential of Generative AI to power such an intelligent travel agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Gen AI Capabilities Utilized\n",
        "\n",
        "This project leverages the following Generative AI capabilities, drawing from the provided Capstone Project Capabilities List:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Few-shot Prompting**: The generation of the initial travel promotion descriptions was guided by a set of explicit few-shot examples. These examples demonstrated the desired format and content style for different Caribbean destinations and themes, allowing the LLM to learn from these provided instances when generating new content. (Reference the few_shot_examples list in the code).\n",
        "- **Embeddings**: We utilized the Gemini embedding model to create numerical representations (embeddings) of the generated travel promotion descriptions. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, enabling us to perform efficient semantic similarity searches.\n",
        "- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: The core of our recommendation system employs RAG. When a user enters a query, we generate an embedding of the query and then use vector search to retrieve the most semantically similar travel promotions from our embedded database. The descriptions of these retrieved promotions are then presented to the user as relevant recommendations.\n",
        "- **Vector Search**: The vector_search function implements the capability to find the top-N most similar embeddings to a user's query embedding. This function calculates cosine similarity between the query embedding and the embeddings of the travel promotions, ranking them by similarity to retrieve the most relevant ones.\n",
        "- **Gen AI Evaluation**: Although not a fully automated evaluation pipeline, the project includes a step where the generated travel promotion descriptions are evaluated by the LLM itself based on criteria like relevance, attractiveness, conciseness, and accuracy. This demonstrates a basic form of Gen AI evaluation."

        "\n",
        "This section defines the `conversational_travel_agent` function, which provides an interactive experience for users to get travel recommendations. It simulates a conversation where the user can input their preferences, and the system will respond with relevant Caribbean getaway options based on the RAG implementation we've built.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Function Definition:** The `conversational_travel_agent` function takes an optional boolean argument `offer_interaction`, which defaults to `True`. This flag controls whether the interactive prompt is offered to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Offering Interaction:** If `offer_interaction` is `True`, the function prompts the user if they would like to try the Caribbean Getaway Recommender. It takes user input and converts it to lowercase.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Interactive Loop:** If the user responds with 'yes', the function enters a `while True` loop, allowing for multiple queries within the same session:\n",
        "    * **User Input:** It prompts the user to enter their travel preferences or type 'no' to continue to the next step (which will break the loop).\n",
        "    * **Exiting the Loop:** If the user enters 'no', the loop breaks, and an \"Exiting the travel agent.\" message is printed.\n",
        "    * **Searching for Promotions:** For any other input, the `travel_agent_rag_search` function (defined in a previous cell) is called with the user's query, the `generated_promotions` data, and a `top_n` of 3 to find the most relevant travel options.\n",
        "    * **Displaying Recommendations:** If matching promotions are found:\n",
        "        * It prints a header indicating the recommendations.\n",
        "        * It iterates through the `matching_promotions`. To avoid showing the same destination multiple times if it appears in the top results with slightly different details, it uses a `set` called `displayed_destinations` to keep track of already shown destinations.\n",
        "        * For each unique destination, it prints the destination name, description, and any available price per person, trip duration in nights, inclusions, and availability (starting Fridays). It numbers each unique option for better readability.\n",
        "    * **Handling No Results:** If no matching promotions are found for the user's query, a \"Sorry, no getaways found.\" message is displayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Skipping Interaction:** If the initial response to the \"Would you like to try...\" prompt is not 'yes', or if the `offer_interaction` flag is set to `False`, the function prints \"Skipping the interactive travel agent demo.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block handles potential `EOFError` (if no input is received, e.g., in a non-interactive environment) and `KeyboardInterrupt` (if the user interrupts the input, e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C), gracefully skipping the interactive demo in these cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Main Execution Block:** The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `conversational_travel_agent()` function is called when the script is executed directly, with `offer_interaction` set to `True` by default, thus starting the interactive session."

        "\n",
        "This notebook has demonstrated the development of a simulated AI-powered travel agent specializing in Caribbean getaways. By effectively leveraging Generative AI capabilities, including few-shot prompting for dynamic content generation, embeddings for capturing semantic meaning, vector search for efficiently finding relevant information, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent and context-aware search, and even a basic form of Gen AI evaluation, we have shown how an LLM can provide relevant and engaging travel recommendations based on user queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key achievements of this project include**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Successfully generated diverse and appealing promotional content for a range of Caribbean destinations using few-shot prompting.\n",
        "- The creation of a semantic search mechanism, powered by embeddings and vector search, that can understand the intent behind user queries and retrieve relevant travel options even without exact keyword matches.\n",
        "- The implementation of a basic conversational interface allowing users to interact with the travel agent and receive recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**While this project provides a solid foundation and showcases several key Gen AI capabilities, there are numerous potential avenues for future exploration and improvement**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Integration with real-time data sources: Connecting to APIs for flight and accommodation availability and pricing would make the agent significantly more practical.\n",
        "- Function Calling: Implementing function calling would allow the agent to interact with external tools and services, such as checking availability or even simulating booking processes.\n",
        "- Personalization: Incorporating user history and preferences to provide even more tailored and relevant recommendations.\n",
        "- More sophisticated conversational capabilities: Enhancing the agent's ability to understand complex queries, ask clarifying questions, and engage in more natural and multi-turn dialogue.\n",
        "- Multimodal integration: Incorporating images and videos into the recommendations to create a richer and more engaging user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "This Capstone Project serves as a valuable demonstration of the transformative power of Generative AI in **revolutionizing the travel planning experience**, offering a glimpse into a future where AI agents can provide truly personalized and intuitive travel assistance."
